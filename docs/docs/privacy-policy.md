# HARlytics Privacy Policy

**Last Updated: April 16, 2025**

## Introduction

HARlytics is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains our data practices for the HARlytics Chrome Extension, Microsoft Edge Add-on, official website (https://harlytics.com/), and cloud version (https://cloud.harlytics.com/).

## Browser Extensions (Chrome and Edge)

For the HARlytics Chrome Extension and Microsoft Edge Add-on:

- **No Data Collection**: We do not collect, transmit, or store any of your data. All analysis is performed locally in your browser.
- **Local Processing**: All HTTP Archive (HAR) files are processed entirely on your device. No information from these files is sent to our servers or any third parties.
- **Minimal Local Storage**: Currently, we do not use cookies or localStorage. However, in the future, we may implement features that store your preferences (such as dark mode settings or language preferences) locally on your device using cookies or localStorage. This data will remain on your device and will not be transmitted to our servers.
- **No Tracking**: We do not use any tracking technologies in our browser extensions to monitor your browsing behavior.
- **No Personal Information**: We do not collect any personal information such as your IP address, browser details, or browsing history.

## Website and Cloud Version

For the HARlytics website (https://harlytics.com/) and cloud version (https://cloud.harlytics.com/):

- **Cloudflare Web Analytics**: We use Cloudflare Web Analytics to collect anonymous usage data. Cloudflare Web Analytics does not use cookies or localStorage, and does not "fingerprint" individuals via their IP address, User Agent string, or any other data for analytics purposes.
- **Data Collected**: The analytics service collects information such as page views, visits, referral sources, top pages viewed, country-level location data, and device types. This data is measured using the concept of a "visit" - defined as a page view with an HTTP referrer that doesn't match the hostname of the request.
- **Privacy-First Approach**: We don't track individual users over time for analytics purposes. The data collected is aggregated and cannot be used to identify you personally.
- **Performance Metrics**: Core Web Vitals and other performance metrics may be collected to help us improve the service.

## Data Security

- **HAR File Security**: HAR files can contain sensitive information. We strongly recommend reviewing and sanitizing HAR files before sharing them with anyone.
- **Local Analysis**: Our browser extensions are designed to analyze HAR files locally without transmitting any data over the internet.
- **No Data Storage**: Since we don't collect data through our browser extensions, there is no risk of your data being exposed through our services.

## Third-Party Services

- Except for Cloudflare Web Analytics on our website and cloud version, we do not use any third-party services that would collect data about you.
- Our browser extensions do not integrate with any third-party analytics or tracking services.

## Children's Privacy

Our services are not directed to individuals under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page and updating the "Last Updated" date.
